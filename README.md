# AI Risk Report â€“ Web (English Edition)

A Streamlit web app to assemble low-cost data (Yahoo Finance, Google News RSS, FRED, SEC/ASX) into a complete **risk report** with:
- Price charts and risk metrics (annualized volatility, Sharpe, max drawdown, correlation)
- Historical-simulation VaR/ES
- Stress scenarios (uniform shocks) and worst daily losses
- ESG (Yahoo Sustainability, best-effort)
- SEC/ASX disclosures list, optional LLM summaries
- One-click Markdown and PDF export

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Notes
- To enable LLM summaries, set **OpenAI API Key** in the sidebar or `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var.
- For SEC (EDGAR) fetching, edit `filings.py` and set a **real contact email** in the `User-Agent` per SEC rules.
- Yahoo ESG is best-effort; not all tickers have sustainability data.
- This is an MVP; for production add caching, retries, robots compliance, and structured HTML->PDF rendering.
